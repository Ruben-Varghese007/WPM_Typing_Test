# WPM Typing Test
A Typing Speed Test built with HTML, CSS and JS. A simple web app that allows users to test their typing speed in words per minute (WPM). 
This project measures how quickly users can type a given passage of text and provides real-time feedback on their typing accuracy and speed.

## About the Test
This is a simple test of typing speed, measuring words per minute, or WPM.

The standard measure of WPM is (number of characters / 5) / (time taken). 
By that measurement, "quick brown fox" is 15 characters, including spaces.

The recorded score is WPM * Accuracy.
